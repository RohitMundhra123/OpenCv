There is an image which contains road map which has traffic light and road under construction. Our task is to detect traffic light and road which are under construction

The "Maze Detection" project is a computer vision project that I developed in Jupyter Notebook using Python. The project involved detecting road under construction and traffic lights in maze drawings with black lines. The maze images were processed using OpenCV, an open-source computer vision library, and were analyzed to detect the presence of a red line, which indicated the presence of a traffic light, and the absence of a line, which indicated that the road was under construction.

The "Maze Detection" project was a challenging yet rewarding project that required skills in computer vision, image processing, and programming. By successfully detecting the road under construction and traffic lights in the maze drawings, the project showcased my ability to develop solutions using computer vision techniques to real-world problems.

The "Maze Detection" project name effectively conveys the objective of the project, which is detecting the presence of road construction and traffic lights in maze drawings.
